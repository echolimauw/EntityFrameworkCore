EntityFrameworkCore

This is a repository of notable projects made while I was at Coding Dojo Seattle from May through September 2019.
These were all initially made while I was active in the C# section of the Coding Dojo cirriculum.
Some files will continue to have additional commits pushed. Please see individual commit comments for details.

All projects contained in this repository are written in C# on the Entity Framework Core.
They also all employ basic CRUD commands (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manipulate data in a database.
Below is a list of the projects in this repository, along with a short description beyond the above details.

    - ActivityCenter
        A web application that allows users to create and share favorite activities.
        User registration and login are done through partials on a shared login/registration page.
        Users make and join plans together through the use of forms and tables.

    - CRUDelicious
        A web application that allows entries of dishes into a database by passing data through a form.
        The form takes information that matches the model for the Dish object and creates a new MySQL entry for it.

    - LoginAndReg
        A web application that allows users to register and login.
        Encrypts stored passwords through hashes for security purposes.

    - WeddingPlanner
        A web application that allows users to plan and share their own weddings or RSVP to those made by other users.
        Includes full LoginAndReg application embedded
